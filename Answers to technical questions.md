1) How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
Ans : I have spent 16 hours on the coding test. Currently I have made different HTML structure for mobile view and desktop view. If I had more time I will try to convert tabs into accordion using jquery for optimization of page load.

2) How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
Ans : Below listed elements affect the performance of a website. By checking these elements in website we can track a performance issue in production.
a) Network connectivity
b) Slow servers and loading time
c) Poorly written code
d) Lack of load balancing
e) Specific HTML title tags

I have tested sites using GTmetrix and W3C validator. GTmetrix is used for checking page speed and load testing. And W3C validator used to check validation of HTML structure.
